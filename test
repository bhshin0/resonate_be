I finally got my new apartment all sorted out and moved in all my stuff. The complex is pretty nice, but I'm still getting used to the noise from the highway outside.\n\nI started my new job at a tech firm downtown. The commute is a bit of a pain, but the views of the city from the train are worth it. My job as a software engineer is pretty demanding, but I'm excited to learn and take on new challenges.\nAfter work, I stopped by the grocery store to grab some essentials. I'm still trying to figure out the city's public transportation system, and it took me a while to get back to my place. I ended up walking the last mile or so, which was nice but also exhausting.",
